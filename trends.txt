1.Tempurature and latitude seem to have a correlation. The highest tempuratures seem to congregate around 18 to 20 degrees of latitude, not exactly at the equator.

2. Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed are not correlated with Latitude.

3. Cloudiness tends to be measured on a scale that favors even numbers, not a strict scale.
